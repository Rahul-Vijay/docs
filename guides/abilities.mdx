### What is an Ability?

An Ability in Convogenie.ai is a built-in feature or skill that your AI chat agent can use to handle conversations smarter, faster, and more effectively. Think of it like giving your agent different tools depending on the job some help with sales, others help with support, while some improve the overall user experience. Each ability can be toggled ON or OFF based on what your business needs.

### How to Use an Ability

Using an ability is very simple. Just go to the "Abilities" section on the left-hand menu, and you’ll see a list of available features. Each one has a short description and a switch (toggle button). Slide the toggle ON to activate it, and OFF to disable it. Once turned on, the AI will start using that ability automatically in conversations — no coding or setup needed.

### Custom Tools and APIs

If you use custom built software, open source SAAS, or even CRMs, you can give the APIs as custom tools to the AI Agent. However you need to provide a good title and description. This is important because, the AI Agent should know when to access this tool and make certain actions possible, and this is through the tool description and what known parameters to be passed.

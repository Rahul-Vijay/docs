    Or enable [Custom Tools](https://docs.convogenie.ai/custom-tools) to give the AI Agent access to your system to read and write from\!

  <Step title="Attach Prompt" stepNumber={2} titleSize="p">
    Add your desired behaviour or choose a default ready made prompt to get started in the [prompts section](https://platform.convogenie.ai/prompts). Our AI can generate prompts for you.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Data" stepNumber={3} titleSize="p">
    If you'd like your AI Agent to reference certain data, you can load up its [knowledge base](https://platform.convogenie.ai/knowledge-base) with relevant docs and images.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test at the Playground" stepNumber={4} titleSize="p">
    Now, before you deploy this AI Agent, test this thoroughly at our AI [Playground](https://platform.convogenie.ai/ui-v2/playground) with your configurations such as enabled abilities, custom tools, prompts, and relavant data. Take the AI Agent for a spin\!
